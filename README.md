## Lab 13: Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern
1. in this lap i Using Dependency Injection,refactor your Hotels, Rooms, and Amenities Controllers to depend on an interface rather than the DbContext
2. Build an interface for each of the controllers that contain the required method signatures to all for CRUD operations to the database directly.
3. Update each of the controllers to inject the interface rather than the DBContext.
4. Create a service for each of the controllers that implement the appropriate interface. Build out the logic to satisfy the interface by making the appropriate calls to the db for each action.
5.  Update your Controller to use the appropriate method from the interface rather than the DBContext directly.
6. Confirm in POSTMAN that your controllers are returning the same logic as they did in Lab 12.
